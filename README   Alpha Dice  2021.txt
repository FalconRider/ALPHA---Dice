------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A virtual 26 sided object. Appropriatly lettered with the alphabet.
Capital letters only.
Written in Python.
Returns one psuedo-random  letter in range   " A to Z "
Shows some process so you can see the guts and that all players (letters )got a fair shot.

Random Alphabetic Selection  Generator

Do you need a fair place to start in a list of alphabetical elemets?
Or to prove you at least tried to be fair?

Like in a class team  or group of employees? You don't always want to start at A or at least prove you didn't influence the choice towards your mate. This little utility gives you your first  selection and then you would go alphabetcally, looping back to A after Z.
Python but works from Windows desktop by planting a shortcut and icon.
Seeded by datetime. Not truly Random, but good enough for fun.

Notes:
I know, its only 1 indicator, so it should be "Alpha Die", but that title might confuse about
the intent of this utility and get the spam bots excited.
Also: I explored using Dwaves Quantum Advantage computer to make the RNG function more R  but 26 isn't a power of 2 and I didn't think any padding wouldn't add more bias that I was eliminating .

It was a fun exercise meant to practice python project building.  
See jpg for example of it working.
